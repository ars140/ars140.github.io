During my time at GE Power Conversion, I was part of a New Product Introduction
(NPI) for developing algorithms and platforms to preemptively diagnose motor
failures. As part of this project, I had the opportunity to help submit four
patent applications to the USPTO and EPO.

Below are the four filings, two of which have been granted as of 2020:

- [US20180293124A1:](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180293124A1/) Method
and System for Determining and Reporting Equipment Operating Conditions and
Health Status *(Granted in 2019)*
- [US10564204B2:](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10564204B2/) Method and
system for diagnostics and monitoring of electric machines *(Granted in 2020)*
- [US20180287545A1:](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180287545A1/)
Dynamic Parameter Limiting Based on Asset Performance and Health Status
- [US20180275698A1:](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180275698A1/) Health
monitoring system having a power converter controller for an electric machine
