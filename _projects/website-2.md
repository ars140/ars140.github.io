title: Personal Website, Version 2.0

In December 2020, I decided to make a 2.0 version of my website, migrating it
from Django to Jekyll.

The [1.0 version](website-1.html) of my website was written using Python and
Django, and hosted on PythonAnywhere. This new website uses the static site
generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and is hosted using [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com). This is a much simpler setup, more suited for
my limited needs (and as an added bonus, hosting of Jekyll on GitHub Pages is
free).
